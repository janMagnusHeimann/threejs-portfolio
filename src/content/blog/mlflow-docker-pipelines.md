# Building Scalable Machine Learning Pipelines with MLflow and Docker

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, deploying machine learning models to production requires more than just good algorithms. This article explores how to build robust, scalable ML pipelines using MLflow for experiment tracking and Docker for containerization.

## Key Components

### 1. MLflow for Experiment Management
- **Model Registry**: Version control for ML models
- **Experiment Tracking**: Monitor metrics, parameters, and artifacts
- **Model Serving**: Deploy models as REST APIs

### 2. Docker for Containerization
- **Reproducible Environments**: Consistent deployment across platforms
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with orchestration tools
- **Isolation**: Prevent dependency conflicts

## Implementation Strategy

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from mlflow.models import infer_signature

# Track experiment
with mlflow.start_run():
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", f1)
    
    # Log model
    signature = infer_signature(X_test, predictions)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model", signature=signature)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Everything**: Code, data, and models
2. **Automate Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests
3. **Monitor Performance**: Real-time model performance tracking
4. **Implement CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

## Conclusion

Building scalable ML pipelines requires careful consideration of tooling, architecture, and operational practices. MLflow and Docker provide a solid foundation for production ML systems.
