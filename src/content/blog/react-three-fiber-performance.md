# Optimizing React Three Fiber Performance

## Introduction

React Three Fiber (R3F) brings the power of Three.js to React applications, but achieving smooth 60fps performance requires careful optimization. This guide covers essential techniques for building performant 3D web experiences.

## Key Optimization Strategies

### 1. Geometry and Material Optimization

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

function OptimizedMesh() {
  // Memoize geometry to prevent recreation
  const geometry = useMemo(() => new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32), [])
  
  // Reuse materials across instances
  const material = useMemo(() => new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ 
    color: 'hotpink' 
  }), [])
  
  return <mesh geometry={geometry} material={material} />
}
```

### 2. Instancing for Multiple Objects

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { InstancedMesh } from 'three'

function InstancedSpheres({ count = 1000 }) {
  const meshRef = useRef()
  
  useFrame(() => {
    // Animate instances efficiently
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      // Update individual instance transforms
    }
  })
  
  return (
    <instancedMesh ref={meshRef} args={[geometry, material, count]}>
      {/* Individual instances */}
    </instancedMesh>
  )
}
```

### 3. Level of Detail (LOD)

```jsx
import { Detailed } from '@react-three/drei'

function LODModel() {
  return (
    <Detailed distances={[0, 10, 20]}>
      <HighQualityModel />
      <MediumQualityModel />
      <LowQualityModel />
    </Detailed>
  )
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Frame Rate Monitoring
- Use `useFrame` callback timing
- Implement performance budgets
- Monitor GPU utilization

### Memory Management
- Dispose of unused geometries and materials
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects
- Monitor memory leaks with DevTools

## Best Practices

1. **Frustum Culling**: Don't render objects outside the camera view
2. **Texture Optimization**: Use appropriate texture sizes and formats
3. **Shader Optimization**: Minimize fragment shader complexity
4. **Batch Operations**: Group similar rendering operations

## Conclusion

Building performant 3D web applications requires a deep understanding of both React and Three.js optimization techniques. By following these practices, you can create smooth, engaging 3D experiences that run well across devices.
