    content: `## Introduction

In the world of deep learning, choosing the right framework can make the difference between a smooth development experience and endless frustration. PyTorch has emerged as one of the most popular choices among researchers and practitioners alike, known for its intuitive design, dynamic computation graphs, and Pythonic nature. Whether you're building your first neural network or developing state-of-the-art models, PyTorch provides the tools and flexibility you need.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR) and released in 2016. Built on the Torch library, PyTorch brings the power of GPU-accelerated tensor computations to Python with an emphasis on flexibility and ease of use.

What sets PyTorch apart is its philosophy: it's designed to be intuitive and Pythonic, making it feel like a natural extension of Python rather than a separate framework. This approach has made it the preferred choice for many researchers, leading to its adoption in countless research papers and production systems at companies like Tesla, Uber, and Microsoft.

## Core Concepts and Components

### 1. Tensors: The Foundation

At the heart of PyTorch are tensors—multi-dimensional arrays similar to NumPy's ndarrays but with GPU acceleration capabilities. Tensors are the basic building blocks for all computations in PyTorch.

\`\`\`python
import torch

# Creating tensors
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = torch.zeros(3, 4)  # 3x4 matrix of zeros
z = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)  # 2x3x4 tensor with random values

# Moving tensors to GPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    x = x.to('cuda')
    # or x = x.cuda()
\`\`\`

### 2. Autograd: Automatic Differentiation

PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, autograd, is what makes training neural networks possible. It automatically computes gradients for tensor operations, enabling backpropagation without manual derivative calculations.

\`\`\`python
# Enable gradient computation
x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2 + 3 * x + 1

# Compute gradients
y.sum().backward()
print(x.grad)  # Gradients: dy/dx = 2x + 3
\`\`\`

### 3. Neural Network Module (torch.nn)

The \`torch.nn\` module provides high-level building blocks for constructing neural networks. It includes pre-built layers, activation functions, and loss functions.

\`\`\`python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)
\`\`\`

### 4. Optimizers

PyTorch provides various optimization algorithms through \`torch.optim\`, making it easy to train models with different optimization strategies.

\`\`\`python
model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_data, batch_labels in dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(batch_data)
        loss = F.nll_loss(outputs, batch_labels)
        
        # Backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
\`\`\`

## Building Your First Neural Network

Let's walk through a complete example of building and training a neural network for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

\`\`\`python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Define the network
class MNISTNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MNISTNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.25)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 9216)  # Flatten
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)

# Set up data
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
])

train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Initialize model, loss, and optimizer
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = MNISTNet().to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
model.train()
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if batch_idx % 100 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Batch: {batch_idx}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
\`\`\`

## Key Features That Make PyTorch Powerful

### 1. Dynamic Computation Graphs

Unlike static graph frameworks, PyTorch builds its computation graph on-the-fly. This means you can use regular Python control flow (if statements, loops) in your models, making debugging and experimentation much easier.

\`\`\`python
def dynamic_model(x, use_dropout=True):
    x = self.layer1(x)
    if use_dropout:  # Python control flow!
        x = self.dropout(x)
    for i in range(x.size(0)):  # Dynamic loops!
        if x[i].sum() > 0:
            x[i] = self.special_layer(x[i])
    return x
\`\`\`

### 2. Easy Debugging

Since PyTorch executes operations immediately (eager execution), you can use standard Python debugging tools like pdb, print statements, or IDE debuggers to inspect your code.

### 3. Rich Ecosystem

PyTorch has spawned a rich ecosystem of libraries:
- **torchvision**: Computer vision datasets, models, and transforms
- **torchtext**: Natural language processing utilities
- **torchaudio**: Audio processing tools
- **PyTorch Lightning**: High-level framework for organizing PyTorch code
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: State-of-the-art NLP models

### 4. Production Ready

With TorchScript and TorchServe, PyTorch models can be optimized and deployed in production environments:

\`\`\`python
# Convert to TorchScript for production
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)
scripted_model.save('model.pt')

# Load and use in production
loaded = torch.jit.load('model.pt')
prediction = loaded(input_tensor)
\`\`\`

## Advanced PyTorch Features

### Custom Datasets

Creating custom datasets is straightforward with PyTorch's Dataset class:

\`\`\`python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path):
        self.data = self.load_data(data_path)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        sample = self.data[idx]
        # Process and return sample
        return processed_sample
\`\`\`

### Mixed Precision Training

PyTorch supports automatic mixed precision training for faster training with minimal code changes:

\`\`\`python
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

scaler = GradScaler()

for data, target in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    with autocast():
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
    
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
\`\`\`

### Distributed Training

Scale your training across multiple GPUs or machines:

\`\`\`python
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def train(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)
    # Training code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
    mp.spawn(train, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size)
\`\`\`

## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Memory Management
- Use \`del\` and \`torch.cuda.empty_cache()\` to free up GPU memory
- Detach tensors from the computation graph when not needed: \`tensor.detach()\`
- Use gradient checkpointing for very deep models

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Set \`torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\` for convolutional networks
- Use DataLoader with multiple workers: \`num_workers > 0\`
- Profile your code with \`torch.profiler\` to identify bottlenecks

### 3. Reproducibility
\`\`\`python
# Set random seeds for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(42)
torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(42)
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
\`\`\`

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

1. **Forgetting to zero gradients**: Always call \`optimizer.zero_grad()\` before \`loss.backward()\`
2. **Not moving data to the correct device**: Ensure both model and data are on the same device
3. **In-place operations on leaf variables**: Avoid operations like \`x += 1\` on tensors with \`requires_grad=True\`
4. **Memory leaks**: Remember to detach tensors when accumulating losses or metrics

## Getting Started Resources

1. **Official Tutorials**: PyTorch.org provides excellent tutorials for beginners
2. **PyTorch Lightning**: For organizing complex projects
3. **Fast.ai**: High-level library built on PyTorch with excellent courses
4. **Papers with Code**: Find PyTorch implementations of research papers

    category: "ML Engineering",
    content: `## Introduction

The rise of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA has opened up incredible possibilities for AI-powered applications. However, building production-ready LLM applications involves much more than just making API calls to these models. You need to handle prompts, manage conversation history, connect to external data sources, and orchestrate complex workflows. This is where LangChain comes in—a framework designed to simplify and streamline the development of LLM-powered applications.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework created by Harrison Chase in October 2022 that provides a set of tools and abstractions for building applications with LLMs. It's designed around the principle of composability, allowing developers to chain together different components to create sophisticated applications.

The framework addresses several key challenges in LLM application development:
- **Context management**: Handling conversation history and context windows
- **Data connectivity**: Integrating LLMs with external data sources
- **Agent capabilities**: Building LLMs that can use tools and take actions
- **Memory systems**: Implementing short-term and long-term memory for applications
- **Prompt engineering**: Managing and optimizing prompts systematically

LangChain has quickly become one of the most popular frameworks in the LLM ecosystem, with implementations in both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Core Concepts and Components

### 1. Models: The Foundation

LangChain provides a unified interface for working with different LLM providers. Whether you're using OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, or local models, the interface remains consistent.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Standard LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
response = llm("What is the capital of France?")

# Chat model (for conversation-style interactions)
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful geography teacher."),
    HumanMessage(content="What is the capital of France?")
]
response = chat(messages)
\`\`\`

### 2. Prompts: Template Management

Prompt templates help you create reusable, dynamic prompts that can be filled with variables at runtime.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate

# Simple prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["product"],
    template="What are the main features of {product}?"
)

# Chat prompt template
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant that explains technical concepts."),
    ("human", "Explain {concept} in simple terms.")
])

# Using the template
formatted_prompt = prompt.format(product="iPhone 15")
response = llm(formatted_prompt)
\`\`\`

### 3. Chains: Composing Components

Chains are the core of LangChain's composability. They allow you to combine multiple components into a single, reusable pipeline.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain

# Basic LLM Chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
result = chain.run("smartphone")

# Sequential chain - output of one becomes input of next
first_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["topic"],
    template="Write a brief outline about {topic}."
)
second_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["outline"],
    template="Expand this outline into a detailed article: {outline}"
)

chain1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=first_prompt)
chain2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)

overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(
    chains=[chain1, chain2],
    verbose=True
)
result = overall_chain.run("artificial intelligence")
\`\`\`

### 4. Memory: Maintaining Context

LangChain provides various memory implementations to maintain conversation context across interactions.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Buffer memory - stores everything
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Have a conversation
conversation.predict(input="Hi, my name is Alex")
conversation.predict(input="What's my name?")  # Will remember!

# Summary memory - summarizes long conversations
summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=summary_memory,
    verbose=True
)
\`\`\`

### 5. Document Loaders and Text Splitters

For RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications, LangChain provides tools to load and process documents.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load documents
loader = PyPDFLoader("document.pdf")
documents = loader.load()

# Split into chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200
)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
\`\`\`

### 6. Vector Stores and Embeddings

Vector stores enable semantic search over your documents.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

# Create embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create vector store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)

# Search for relevant documents
query = "What is the main topic discussed?"
relevant_docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)
\`\`\`

## Building a RAG Application

Let's build a complete RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application that can answer questions about uploaded documents.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# 1. Load documents
loader = DirectoryLoader('./data', glob="**/*.pdf")
documents = loader.load()

# 2. Split documents
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1500,
    chunk_overlap=200
)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# 3. Create embeddings and vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=splits,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)

# 4. Create retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 4}
)

# 5. Create QA chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4")
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    verbose=True
)

# 6. Ask questions
query = "What are the main points discussed in the documents?"
result = qa_chain({"query": query})

print(f"Answer: {result['result']}")
print(f"Source documents: {result['source_documents']}")
\`\`\`

## Agents: LLMs with Tools

One of LangChain's most powerful features is the ability to create agents—LLMs that can use tools to accomplish tasks.

\`\`\`python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.tools import ShellTool

# Define tools
search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
shell = ShellTool()

tools = [
    Tool(

## Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Chains

Create your own chains for specific use cases:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.chains.base import Chain
from typing import Dict, List

class CustomAnalysisChain(Chain):
    """Custom chain for analyzing text sentiment and extracting entities."""
    
    @property
    def input_keys(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["text"]
    
    @property
    def output_keys(self) -> List[str]:
        return ["sentiment", "entities"]
    
    def _call(self, inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        text = inputs["text"]
        
        # Sentiment analysis
        sentiment_prompt = f"Analyze the sentiment of this text: {text}"
        sentiment = self.llm(sentiment_prompt)
        
        # Entity extraction
        entity_prompt = f"Extract all named entities from this text: {text}"
        entities = self.llm(entity_prompt)
        
        return {
            "sentiment": sentiment,
            "entities": entities
        }
\`\`\`

### 2. Streaming Responses

For better user experience, stream responses as they're generated:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler

# Create LLM with streaming
streaming_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    streaming=True,
    callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()],
    temperature=0
)

# Use in a chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=streaming_llm, prompt=prompt)
chain.run("Tell me a story")  # Will print as it generates
\`\`\`

### 3. LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

LCEL provides a declarative way to compose chains:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough

# Create a chain using LCEL
rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# Run the chain
result = rag_chain.invoke("What is the main topic?")
\`\`\`

### 4. Callbacks and Monitoring

Monitor and control your LangChain applications:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager

# Custom callback
class CustomCallback(StdOutCallbackHandler):
    def on_llm_start(self, serialized, prompts, **kwargs):
        print(f"LLM started with prompt: {prompts[0]}")
    
    def on_llm_end(self, response, **kwargs):
        print(f"LLM finished. Token usage: {response.llm_output}")

# Use callbacks
callback_manager = CallbackManager([CustomCallback()])
llm = ChatOpenAI(callback_manager=callback_manager)
\`\`\`

## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Error Handling

Always implement proper error handling, especially for API calls:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.schema import OutputParserException
import time

def robust_chain_call(chain, input_text, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return chain.run(input_text)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
\`\`\`

### 2. Cost Management

Monitor and control API costs:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback

with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    result = llm("What is the meaning of life?")
    print(f"Total Tokens: ${'{'}{cb.total_tokens}{'}'}")
    print(f"Total Cost: ${'{'}{cb.total_cost}{'}'}")
\`\`\`

### 3. Prompt Optimization

Use few-shot examples for better results:

\`\`\`python
from langchain.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate

examples = [
    {"input": "happy", "output": "sad"},
    {"input": "tall", "output": "short"},
]

example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input", "output"],
    template="Input: {input}\\nOutput: {output}"
)

few_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix="Give the opposite of each input:",
    suffix="Input: {input}\\nOutput:",
    input_variables=["input"]
)
\`\`\`

### 4. Testing

Test your chains thoroughly:

\`\`\`python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_chain():
    # Mock the LLM
    mock_llm = Mock()
    mock_llm.return_value = "Paris"
    
    # Create chain with mock
    chain = LLMChain(llm=mock_llm, prompt=prompt)
    result = chain.run("France")
    
    assert result == "Paris"
    mock_llm.assert_called_once()
\`\`\`

    content: `## Introduction

In the world of high-performance computing, the shift from CPU-only processing to GPU-accelerated computing has been nothing short of revolutionary. At the heart of this transformation lies CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), NVIDIA's parallel computing platform that has democratized GPU programming and enabled breakthroughs in fields ranging from scientific computing to artificial intelligence. Whether you're looking to accelerate your scientific simulations, train deep learning models, or process massive datasets, understanding CUDA is essential.

## What is CUDA?

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA that enables developers to use GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose computing. Introduced in 2006, CUDA transformed GPUs from specialized graphics rendering devices into powerful parallel processors capable of tackling complex computational problems.

The key insight behind CUDA is that many computational problems can be expressed as parallel operations—the same operation applied to many data elements simultaneously. While CPUs excel at sequential tasks with complex branching logic, GPUs with their thousands of cores are perfect for parallel workloads. CUDA provides the tools and abstractions to harness this massive parallelism.

### Why GPU Computing?

Consider this comparison:
- A modern CPU might have 8-16 cores, each optimized for sequential execution
- A modern GPU has thousands of smaller cores designed for parallel execution
- For parallelizable tasks, GPUs can be 10-100x faster than CPUs

## Core Concepts and Architecture

### 1. The CUDA Programming Model

CUDA extends C/C++ with a few key concepts:

\`\`\`cuda
// CPU code (host)
int main() {
    int *h_data, *d_data;  // h_ for host, d_ for device
    int size = 1024 * sizeof(int);
    
    // Allocate memory on host
    h_data = (int*)malloc(size);
    
    // Allocate memory on GPU
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
    
    // Copy data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    
    // Launch kernel with 256 blocks, 1024 threads per block
    myKernel<<<256, 1024>>>(d_data);
    
    // Copy results back
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_data);
    free(h_data);
}

// GPU code (device)
__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    data[idx] = data[idx] * 2;  // Simple operation
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Thread Hierarchy

CUDA organizes threads in a hierarchical structure:

- **Thread**: The basic unit of execution
- **Block**: A group of threads that can cooperate and share memory
- **Grid**: A collection of blocks

\`\`\`cuda
// Understanding thread indexing
__global__ void indexExample() {
    // Global thread ID calculation
    int globalIdx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    // 2D grid example
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int idx = y * gridDim.x * blockDim.x + x;
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Memory Hierarchy

CUDA provides several memory types with different characteristics:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void memoryExample(float *input, float *output) {
    // Shared memory - fast, shared within block
    __shared__ float tile[256];
    
    // Registers - fastest, private to each thread
    float temp = input[threadIdx.x];
    
    // Global memory - large but slow
    output[threadIdx.x] = temp;
    
    // Constant memory - cached, read-only
    // Texture memory - cached, optimized for 2D locality
}
\`\`\`

### 4. GPU Architecture Basics

Modern NVIDIA GPUs consist of:
- **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**: Independent processors that execute blocks
- **CUDA Cores**: Basic arithmetic units within SMs
- **Warp Schedulers**: Manage thread execution in groups of 32 (warps)
- **Memory Controllers**: Handle data movement

## Writing Your First CUDA Program

Let's create a complete CUDA program that adds two vectors:

\`\`\`cuda
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// CUDA kernel for vector addition
__global__ void vectorAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    // Calculate global thread ID
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    // Boundary check
    if (tid < n) {
        c[tid] = a[tid] + b[tid];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1000000;  // 1 million elements
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);
    
    // Allocate host memory
    float *h_a = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_b = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_c = (float*)malloc(size);
    
    // Initialize input vectors
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        h_a[i] = i;
        h_b[i] = i * 2;
    }
    
    // Allocate device memory
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    cudaMalloc(&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc(&d_c, size);
    
    // Copy input data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    
    // Launch kernel
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);
    
    // Copy result back to host
    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
    // Verify results
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%.0f + %.0f = %.0f\\n", h_a[i], h_b[i], h_c[i]);
    }
    
    // Cleanup
    free(h_a); free(h_b); free(h_c);
    cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
    
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

Compile and run:
\`\`\`bash
nvcc vector_add.cu -o vector_add
./vector_add
\`\`\`

## Advanced CUDA Features

### 1. Shared Memory Optimization

Shared memory is crucial for performance optimization:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void matrixMultiplyShared(float *A, float *B, float *C, int width) {
    __shared__ float tileA[16][16];
    __shared__ float tileB[16][16];
    
    int bx = blockIdx.x, by = blockIdx.y;
    int tx = threadIdx.x, ty = threadIdx.y;
    
    int row = by * 16 + ty;
    int col = bx * 16 + tx;
    
    float sum = 0.0f;
    
    // Loop over tiles
    for (int tile = 0; tile < width/16; tile++) {
        // Load tiles into shared memory
        tileA[ty][tx] = A[row * width + tile * 16 + tx];
        tileB[ty][tx] = B[(tile * 16 + ty) * width + col];
        __syncthreads();
        
        // Compute partial product
        for (int k = 0; k < 16; k++) {
            sum += tileA[ty][k] * tileB[k][tx];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }
    
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Atomic Operations

For concurrent updates to shared data:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void histogram(int *data, int *hist, int n) {
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (tid < n) {
        atomicAdd(&hist[data[tid]], 1);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Dynamic Parallelism

Launch kernels from within kernels:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void parentKernel(int *data, int n) {
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        // Launch child kernel
        childKernel<<<1, 256>>>(data + blockIdx.x * 256, 256);
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. CUDA Streams

Enable concurrent operations:

\`\`\`cuda
cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

// Async operations on different streams
cudaMemcpyAsync(d_a, h_a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1);
cudaMemcpyAsync(d_b, h_b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream2);

kernel1<<<grid, block, 0, stream1>>>(d_a);
kernel2<<<grid, block, 0, stream2>>>(d_b);

cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);
\`\`\`

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Coalesced Memory Access

Ensure threads access contiguous memory:

\`\`\`cuda
// Good - coalesced access
__global__ void good(float *data) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    float val = data[idx];  // Thread 0->data[0], Thread 1->data[1], etc.
}

// Bad - strided access
__global__ void bad(float *data) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    float val = data[idx * 32];  // Thread 0->data[0], Thread 1->data[32], etc.
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Occupancy Optimization

Balance resources for maximum throughput:

\`\`\`cuda
// Use CUDA occupancy calculator
int blockSize;
int minGridSize;
cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize(&minGridSize, &blockSize, myKernel, 0, 0);

// Launch with optimal configuration
myKernel<<<minGridSize, blockSize>>>(data);
\`\`\`

### 3. Warp-Level Primitives

Leverage warp-level operations:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void warpReduce(float *data) {
    float val = data[threadIdx.x];
    
    // Warp-level reduction
    for (int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
        val += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, val, offset);
    }
    
    if (threadIdx.x % 32 == 0) {
        // Thread 0 of each warp has the sum
        atomicAdd(output, val);
    }
}
\`\`\`

## CUDA Libraries and Ecosystem

NVIDIA provides highly optimized libraries:

### 1. cuBLAS - Linear Algebra

\`\`\`cpp
#include <cublas_v2.h>

cublasHandle_t handle;
cublasCreate(&handle);

// Matrix multiplication: C = alpha * A * B + beta * C
cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N,
            m, n, k, &alpha,
            d_A, m, d_B, k, &beta, d_C, m);
\`\`\`

### 2. cuDNN - Deep Learning

\`\`\`cpp
#include <cudnn.h>

cudnnHandle_t cudnn;
cudnnCreate(&cudnn);

// Convolution forward pass
cudnnConvolutionForward(cudnn, &alpha, xDesc, x, wDesc, w,
                        convDesc, algo, workspace, workspaceSize,
                        &beta, yDesc, y);
\`\`\`

### 3. Thrust - C++ Template Library

\`\`\`cpp
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/sort.h>

thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(1000000);
thrust::sort(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end());
\`\`\`

## Debugging and Profiling

### 1. Error Checking

Always check CUDA errors:

\`\`\`cuda
#define CUDA_CHECK(call) \\
    do { \\
        cudaError_t error = call; \\
        if (error != cudaSuccess) { \\
            fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error at %s:%d - %s\\n", \\
                    __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(error)); \\
            exit(1); \\
        } \\
    } while(0)

// Usage
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_data, size));
\`\`\`

### 2. NVIDIA Nsight Tools

- **Nsight Systems**: System-wide performance analysis
- **Nsight Compute**: Kernel-level profiling
- **cuda-memcheck**: Memory error detection

\`\`\`bash
# Profile your application
nsys profile ./my_cuda_app
ncu --set full ./my_cuda_app
\`\`\`

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### 1. Memory Management
- Always free allocated memory
- Use cudaMallocManaged for unified memory when appropriate
- Be aware of memory bandwidth limitations

### 2. Thread Divergence
\`\`\`cuda
// Avoid divergent branches
if (threadIdx.x < 16) {
    // Half the warp takes this path
} else {
    // Other half takes this path - causes divergence
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Grid and Block Size Selection
- Block size should be multiple of 32 (warp size)
- Consider hardware limits (max threads per block, registers)
- Use occupancy calculator for guidance

### 4. Synchronization
\`\`\`cuda
// Block-level synchronization
__syncthreads();

// Device-level synchronization
cudaDeviceSynchronize();
\`\`\`
